# 🐍 Python Automation Practice

Welcome to my **Python Automation Repository** 👋  
This repo is where I store and track all the small automation scripts I’ve been learning and building with Python.

---

## 🚀 Purpose
This repository helps me:
- Practice Python scripting
- Learn how to automate daily tasks
- Keep track of what I’ve learned
- Experiment with libraries like `os`, `subprocess`, `scapy`, and more

---

## 📂 Contents
| Script Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `ping.py` | Sends ICMP packets (ping) to test connectivity using Scapy |
| `file_cleanup.py` | Automates cleanup of temporary files |
| `rename_files.py` | Renames multiple files automatically |
| `backup_script.py` | Creates simple file or folder backups |

*(More scripts will be added as I continue learning.)*

## 🧠 What I’m Learning
- Basics of Python scripting  
- Network automation using `Scapy` and `socket`  
- File system automation with `os` and `shutil`  
- Error handling and logging  
- Using Git & GitHub for version control
